# Average-Bowling-Scores-Calculator
The Average Bowling Scores Calculator reads in
from a file the name of the bowler and their final
score from five games. The program will then
calculate their average score and will
output the bowlers name, scores, and average score
in the form of a chart. To make the code more efficient
the program utilizes a structure to reduce the amount of
varibles and memory allocated.
